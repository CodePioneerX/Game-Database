# Game Database Management System (GDBMS)

# Overview
- This project focuses on creating a robust Game Database Management System (GDBMS) utilizing data from external APIs, namely RAWG API and IGDB API, to gather comprehensive information about various games. The system processes this data, merges it, and populates a MySQL database, ensuring data integrity and providing simplified views for easy access. Additionally, the project involves transitioning the database design from SQL to NoSQL using Neo4j, streamlining the data transfer process while incorporating design changes based on project requirements.
